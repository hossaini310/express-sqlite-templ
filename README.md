# Express Server Template

This is a simple template for an Express server with **SQLite** integration that can be used as a starting point for new projects.

## Usage

To use this template, run the following command to generate a new project based on this template:

```
npx degit hossaini310/express-sqlite-templ your-project
```

This will create a new directory called `your-project` that contains the files from this template. Next, see the [Setup](#setup) section below for instructions on how to set up and use this template.

### Setup

The following steps are required to set up and use this template:

1. Generate a new project based on this template with the command:
   `npx degit hossaini310/express-sqlite-templ your-project`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the variables from the `.env.example` file
3. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Start the production server with `npm run start`
6. To set up your own SQLite database, you'll need to edit the `initdb.js` and `db.sql` files.
7. Once you've made the necessary changes, run the command `npm run initdb`.
8. Congratulations! You now have your own express server with SQLite integration.
